# NO PULL REQUESTS ON THIS PROJECT

We would like to announce that Spark Kernel has been accepted into Apache Incubator and has moved all development to [Apache Toree](https://github.com/apache/incubator-toree). 

Here are a couple of things to look for as part of the move:
- Contributions are welcomed! If you want to help us out or got an idea for a new feature... bring it on.
- Finally, binary releases of the kernel.
- Published artifacts on maven central for other projects to easily consume.

Our [README](https://github.com/apache/incubator-toree/blob/master/README.md) is now updated with links to Issue Tracker and Mailing List.
